## What Is an Xbox Gift Card?

An Xbox gift card is a pre-paid digital or physical card that allows users to redeem credits on Xbox Live, Microsoft Store, or Xbox Game Pass. These gift cards offer convenience by allowing users to buy digital content without entering payment details. You can use these cards to buy:
